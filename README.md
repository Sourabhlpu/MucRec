    MucRec 
    
   Description: 
    
    This android app help users identify the music that is playing around buy just a click of a button. It is quite similar to the 
    Shazam app or the SoundHound app. This is a project where I can learn explore new things.
    
    I have used the MVP pattern to organize the code and be modular. 
    
    Screens :  
    
    There are 3 main screens in the app.
    
    1. Discover Screen
    
     Here you can tap in the middle which will show a nice ripple animation to identify the song

    2. Song details Screen
    
    This screen opens up once the music is identified successfully.
